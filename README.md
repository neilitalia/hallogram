## 📝 About

Do you want to go trick-or-treating without leaving the house? Hallogram is here! It's a digital social space for posting your best costumes, getting applauses, and receiving digital treats, all from the safety and comfort of your own home.

## 🚦 Getting Started 

To use our app, sign up with your name, email, and tip jar (either with CashApp, Venmo, or PayPal) to receive treats. After onboarding, you can post your best halloween costume with a selfie of you wearing it and a post caption. Your posts can receive attention with an applause. You can "clap" on a post as many times as you want. And if you want to take your post off the app, you can easily delete it.
